    Overwatch 2 is a 2022 first-person shooter game by Blizzard Entertainment.
    As a sequel to the 2016 hero shooter Overwatch, the game intends a shared
    environment for player-versus-player (PvP) modes while introducing
    persistent cooperative modes. A major change in PvP modes was to reduce
    team sizes from six to five. Several major characters were also reworked.
    Overwatch 2 is free-to-play on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation
    5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in early access on October 4 and
    features full cross-platform play. This website is about the characters
    and the knowledge of what characters are good against one another.
